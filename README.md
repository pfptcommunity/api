# Introduction to REST APIs

Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API) is a way for applications to seamlessly share data via HTTPS. An API is a building block of code that is used to send data requests from one application to another and deliver data responses back. It’s the messenger who takes a request to the system and returns a response from it. The building block contains endpoints, headers, parameters, and fields. Therefore, you can use the Proofpoint Results API endpoints to request raw data from the platform for use in your Business Intelligence (BI) analysis tools.


A familiar example often used to explain APIs involves ordering food at a restaurant. In this scenario, the
waiter is the API. You give him your food request, he takes your food request to the kitchen, the kitchen
staff prepares the food, and the waiter returns the food to you. You made a request of the kitchen for
food and used the waiter to deliver the request and receive a response (that being the food).
So, back to the Proofpoint Results API and how it works. If a customer wants certain data results (the
food) from the platform (the kitchen) to use in their business analysis tool, they can use the API (the
waiter) to deliver the data request and receive the data response (the food).

What is consuming REST API?
Similarly, the act of consuming or using a REST API means to eat it all up. In context, it means to eat it, swallow it, and digest it — leaving any others in the pile exposed.

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and it is a completely language-independent text format that is mainly used to transmit data between a server and client.
The structure of a JSON object is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax, meaning that data is organised in key/value pairs separated by commas, with the whole of the object being wrapped by curly braces and arrays being wrapped by square brackets, like so:

```
 "identity": {
   "name": "Winston Wolf", 
   "email": [
      "thewolf@fixaprob.com",
      "mr.wolf@fixaprob.com",
      "w.wolf@jmail.com"
   ],
   "department": "Operations", 
   "location": "Amsterdam",
   "title": "Problem solver"
 }
// * JSON Object Structure Sample
```
REST implements multiple 'methods' for different types of http request, the following are most popular: - GET: Get resource from the server. - POST: Create resource to the server.  You can read more about [4 Most Used REST API Authentication Methods.](https://blog.restcase.com/4-most-used-rest-api-authentication-methods/)

Proofpoint provides some lovely REST APIs that can be used to gather information.
Below code snippets and reference will help you getting started.

# Use cases

To shift to data-driven security decision making start with the right data.

## Risk Dashboards with BI tools

We have create several Power BI and Excel examples on howto consume data directly/natively from these business tools. An example can be found in the [TAP Chapter](#TAP-API).


## Identity Governance / Consumer IAM

Identity governance is about making sure each person has exactly the access they need to do their jobs without causing risk to the company. The Proofpoint Very Attacked Person (VAP) data can be easily integrated with your IGA solution to enhance the IGA dataset for decission making.
IGA calculates risk scores for users based on authorizations/access. It makes a lot of sense to enrich the data with VAP data.
See:
- [TAP People API](#TAP-API)
- [Nexus People Risk Explorer (NPRE)](#NPRE-API)

Key players: Sailpoint, Saviynt, One Identity, Microfocus (NetIQ), Omada


## SIEM / UBA / UBEA
xx todo
Risk scores are calculated for each user in UB tools.

# TAP API

The Threat Insight Dashboard (Targeted Attack Protection) provides several different API endpoints for integration with other products in your security ecosystem.

[Official Documentation - Threat Insight Dashboard](https://help.proofpoint.com/Threat_Insight_Dashboard/API_Documentation)

## Microsoft Excel or Power BI consuming TAP API data

Both Microsoft Power BI and Excel can directly fetch JSON data from an REST endpoint. See the [Microsoft doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/connectors/web/web) for more information.  Below you can see and download a sample Excel sheet that fetches data from the People endpoint(s).

| Action  | Description |

Howto: Getting started with Power BI. 

- Open [Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com). I recommend downloading Power BI desktop. 
- Download the pbix sample from this page and open it in Power BI
- click Transform data
- Select function 'Api call keys'
- Open Advanced Editor
- Set your API credentials in the script
- Go back
- click Refresh

## Cool TAP API Code Snippets

The API uses GET requests to retrieve resource representation/information only – and not modify it in any way.

Basic authentication is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol. The client sends HTTP requests with the Authorization header that contains the word Basic word followed by a space and a base64-encoded string.

The TAP REST APIrequest uses the following request structure:

```
method                = get
uri                   = base api path + endpoint + parameter
headers.Authorization = "Basic " + encode.base64 ( principal + ":" + secret )
```

Below code snippets will help you to get started with the initial authentication and get some data from an endpoint.
